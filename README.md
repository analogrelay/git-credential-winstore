# Windows Credential Store for GitThis application is a small helper app designed to follow the git credentials API as defined by the [Git Documentation](https://github.com/gitster/git-htmldocs/blob/master/technical/api-credentials.txt).## Installation1. Download the git-credential-winstore.exe file from the downloads section2. Run it (make sure you have git in your PATH)## FAQs### Why doesn't it work?Make sure you're running the latest version of msysgit. The credential API is fairly new. I've tested this on version 1.7.10.### Why doesn't it install?Make sure one of the following is correct:* running with GIT on your PATH (perhaps by running from the GIT bash shell)+ Environment variable GIT_EXECUTABLE points to the git executable (if you don't want git on your path)### Where are you storing my credentials?This app just uses the existing Windows Credential Store to hold your credentials. You can see the stored credentials by going to Control Panel > User Accounts > Credential Manager and choosing "Windows Credentials". The entries starting "git:" are from git-credential-winstore.### I have another question?That's not a question.### But I actually have another question...Ok, you can email me at [andrew@andrewnurse.net](mailto:andrew@andrewnurse.net).## Special Thanks* [Paul Betts](http://paulbetts.org/) for creating our handy-dandy installer.* [Matt Wrock](https://github.com/mwrock) for adding a silent option to the installer.* [mattn](https://github.com/mattn) for adding support for Windows XP.* [Marc Brooks](https://github.com/IDisposable) for some readme tweaks.## LicenseThis code is Copyright Andrew Nurse and other contributors 2012.
